Since GitHub does not link to organizations by default, I threw together this 
pageas an alternative.  Styling is not my thing. If pressed, I can borrow 
enough web foo to make something that looks okay, such as the 
<a href="http://nexusformat.org">NeXus launch page</a>, but don't expect it 
for this site.

<h2>Projects</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/reflectometry">Reflectometry</a></dt>
<dd>Most of my work over the past decade has been in reflectometry
analysis, which allows users to reconstruct the depth profile of a sample
from the measured reflection.  These projects are hosted on
<a href="http://reflectometry.org/danse/software.html">reflectometry.org</a>
but developed on GitHub.
</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/bumps">Bumps</a></dt>
<dd>For uncertainty analysis in modeling and inverse problems, Bayesian analysis
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo is an effective black box procedure.  Define
your cost function as a probability distribution and MCMC can pull a sample
from the multidimensional probability density function which you can use to
get information about confidence intervals and parameter correlations.  The
Bumps package was developed to provide fitting and uncertainty analysis for
Refl1D, but has since been used for fitting problems in other domains such as
triple axis spectometry.  We plan to make this an independent package during
the summer of 2012, with easy installation from pypi.
</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/scattering/dataflow">Dataflow</a></dt>
<dd>For some many kinds of science the raw data needs to be transformed
through multiple steps and combined with other information to bring it
to a state where it can be modelled.  We are developing a package which
allows us to do this on the web.  We are using a visual programming model
which allows us to wire together the transformations.  My contributions to 
this so far have been to the backend infrastructure, and helping summer 
students produce the front end.  Dataflow is live at 
<a href="http://drneutron.org/">drneutron.org</a>.
</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/pkienzle/periodictable">Periodic table</a></dt>
<dd>There are many large data sets associated with nuclei and ions in the
periodic table.  No one application needs all of them, but they can all
share the basic infrastructure.  The periodic table package is a 
periodic table written in python which allows third party extensions which
add attributes to the element, isotope or ion to be independently managed 
and installed.  It includes a chemical formula calculator, but stops short
of structural representations of molecules.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/">Octave-forge</a></dt>
<dd>I made major contributions to the octave-forge project, gathering
contributions from the community and my own code into a set of independently
installed third party packages for Octave.  I have not been active in
this community for a number of years.
</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/pkienzle">Personal projects</a></dt>
<dd>Being personal these will be of minimal interest to you, dear reader.
My github <a href="http://github.com/pkienzle/pkienzle.github.com">personal webpage</a> 
(this page) is hosted here, as well as 
<a href="http://github.com/pkienzle/pyplay">recent experiments with python</a>.
